# Python Subtitle Editor
This Python application is a specialized tool tailored for editing subtitle files. It primarily addresses the common issue of incorrect special characters that often appear as bugs in downloaded subtitle files. These bugs can be a result of encoding errors, file format incompatibilities, or other technical glitches during the download process.

The app automatically identifies and corrects special characters that have been incorrectly displayed. This includes characters that may appear as gibberish, unrecognized symbols, or misplaced punctuation marks.
